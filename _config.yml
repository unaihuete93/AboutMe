  Hi, my name is Unai and I´m a Azure Cloud & DevOps expert. Passionate for technology, I have been working mainly on these different areas during the last years:  Cloud Computing/DevOps/SRE.

  From February 2017 to July 2020 I have been working  as a PFE (Premier Field Engineer) giving Support & Education to Microsoft´s customers all around EMEA mainly around the following technologies: DevOps (GitHub/Azure DevOps), SRE, Azure Cloud and SCRUM/Agile. 

  Since July 2020, I am working as an Azure Technical trainer on the technologies mentioned above, leading content for "AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions" . Love to learn new things and demo it to customers :) 

  In 2022, I published my first book "The Art of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) with Azure".
